## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Repository**: Manages data persistence and configuration
- **ImageProcessingService**: Background service for image analysis
- **TelegramService**: Handles Telegram bot communication
- **EmailService**: Manages email sending functionality
- **MainViewModel**: Coordinates between UI and business logic

### Technologies Used
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern Android UI framework
- **ML Kit**: Google's ML services for text and face detection
- **OpenAI API**: LLM for receipt analysis
- **Telegram Bot API**: For sending messages and photos
- **JavaMail**: For email functionality
- **DataStore**: Secure configuration storage
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming
- **ViewModel**: UI state management

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are stored securely using Android DataStore
- Images are processed locally when possible
- No data is stored on external servers (except for API calls)
- Email passwords use app-specific passwords, not account passwords

## Permissions Required

- **Camera**: For taking photos (optional)
- **Storage**: For accessing gallery images
- **Internet**: For API calls to OpenAI, Telegram, and email services
- **Foreground Service**: For background image processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration Not Valid**
   - Ensure all fields are filled in the Config tab
   - Check that API keys are correct and active
